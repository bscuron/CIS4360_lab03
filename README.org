* Lab 03 - Hello Kubernetes Node

** Task 1. Create your Node.js application

The first thing that I did was create a JavaScript file named `server.js`. I created the file using `vim`.

To add contents to the file, I entered insert mode by pressing `i` and pasted the JS contents into the file. I then wrote and quit by pressing `<ESC>` to enter normal mode, and `:wq` to write and quit.

I then ran the JS file using Node.js. The command does not produce any output, but it does start a webserver on port 8080.

I navigated to this web server using the GCP console feature: `Web preview`. From this preview, I can see the "Hello World!" message that was located in the `server.js` file.

I then sent a SIGINT signal to the process by pressing `CTRL-c`. This interrupted the process.
